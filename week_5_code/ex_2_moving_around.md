# Moving Around the Terminal

## Moving Around

We have used most of these commands already:

pwd    - present working directory
cd     - change directory
ls     - list
tree   - list as tree

## Exercise

From the command line

1) use tldr to read about cd and tree
2) change your directory to ~/ws/ceiling-zero, and run the tree command
3) list the contents of the ceiling-zero directory
4) read the tldr of the list command.  List the contents of the directory in other ways






## Moving files

mkdir - make directory
mv    - move a file or director
cp    - copy a file
touch - create an empty file
rm    - remove/delete a file
rmdir - remove/delete an emtpy directory


## Exercise

1) cd to ~/ws/ceiling-zero/week_5_code
2) make a directory named "new_dir"
3) create an empty file in the new directory named "new_file.txt"
    you can either cd into the directory, or refer to the file by its full name: new_dir/new_file.txt
4) remove the newly created directory "new_dir"

What went wrong?

5) Fix whatever didn't work, then remove the directory
6) Use one of the help commands to find how to delete a directory that isn't empty
    DONT run it without being very careful.  It's possible to delete your entire computer.
