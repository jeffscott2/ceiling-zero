Practice loading data

* Go to the South Bend data portal and download a dataset in CSV or JSON
* Use the MySQL Workbench Data Import Wizard to import it into a table
* Query the table for the data from the last month (if applicable)

Some of the SB data portal CSVs aren't readable by MySQL Workbench.
- If you open the CSV in LibreOffice (brew cask install libreoffice)
- And "File" -> "Save As..."
    - Change the File Type to "CSV"
    - And save out again
That new file should be importable.
